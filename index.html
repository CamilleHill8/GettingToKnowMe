                    <p>Highland Park is a small town right outside of Downtown Los Angeles. As a child, my neighborhood expereinced gang violence and heavy crime. However, the community was small and 
                        tight-knit. Some of my fondest memories include swimming competitively and playing water polo at the community pool. Over time, Highland Park has become much safer, but this has come at a cost. As 
                        the police began cracking down on local gangs, the community became more attractive to outside investors. Highland Park became a safer but incredibly expensive town - this forced many local who rented in 
                        the area to move to cheaper cities. Overall, growing up in Highland Park provided a unique opportunity for me to develop diverse perspectives and grit. I am happy that it has become a safer place to live.

                    <p">I moved to Utah to attend Brigham Young University for my undergraduate studies. My first major was computer science, but I ended realizing that I enjoy civic engagement much more 
                        and changed my major to Political Science. After graduating in 2019, I considered law school for some time. However, I decided I wanted to work for the government either at the state or federals level. I applied and was accepted to the Master 
                        of Public Administration program at BYU's Marriott School of Business.<br><br>  <img src="images/graduation.JPG" alt="Graduation Photo" width="500"></p>

                    <h1 id="body_text">The MPA Program</h1>
                    <p>The MPA program has been a blast! The first semester is a very heavy class load. Some of the classes we took included Statistical Analysis for Public Organizations, Organization Behavior, Quantitative 
                            Decision Analysis, and many more! The dynamic was unique in that we are put onto teams that we work with for each class. Getting used to this level of team work took some time, but I felt very thankful for 
                            my teammates and the growth I had in the program alongside them. <br>Click <a href="https://marriott.byu.edu/mpa/about/what-is-an-mpa/" style="color: blue;">here</a> to check out the MPA Program!
